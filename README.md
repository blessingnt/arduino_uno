Arduino Code sketches from class

## General Info
This is just a small collection of sketches made during my computer programming class. Using Arduino Cloud editor,
Arduino Uno and C. Most of these sketches are for programming the NeoPixel matrix. In the future I will add my
sketches using the Servo Motor and analog joysticks.
